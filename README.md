# Maze Q Learning
The AI solves a maze using basic Q Learning.

Controls:
'+' to speed up the agent.
'-' to slow down the agent.
'q' to print the Q table at any time during training.

The file Data.xlsx contains the Q table after the AI identified the final path, and also a better representation of the rewards and states arrays.
