# Maze Q Learning
The AI solves a maze using basic Q Learning.

Controls:
Use '+' to speed up the agent.
Use '-' to slow down the agent.
Press 'q' to print the Q table at any time during training.


Packages needed: pyglet, matplotlib and numpy

If you have pip installed (which is there, if you installed python from the official website), install the packages using these commands in the command prompt.

    pip install pyglet
    pip install matplotlib
    pip install numpy

Note: people using anaconda replace 'pip' with 'conda', and use the anaconda prompt, instead of cmd.


The file Data.xlsx contains the Q table after the AI identified the shortest path. The file also contains a better representation of the rewards and states arrays.
